## A passion for building bridges between people and their data

I have an eye for optimisation and automation of data analysis workflows, and I believe in the power of giving people meaningful access to their data.

This means creating interactive data dashboards, and automating reporting by creating eg. Word/Excel/Powerpoint products directly from R.

To bring these solutions to life I use R package development, R markdown, Shiny tidyverse, unit testing, github actions and bash where needed.

I want to make life easier for both the data scientist as well as the people who own the data.

    screening method using DNA barcodes
    (available [here](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?Barracoda-1.8))
  * R package that uses machine learning to trace the organ source of cancer 
    cells via DNA analyses (interface available [here](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?TumorTracer-1.1))

### Publications

```{r scholar_functions, echo=FALSE}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
id <- "UFlhrz0AAAAJ"
pubs <- scholar::get_publications(id)

pubs %>%
  filter(cites > 0 & journal != "") %>%
  mutate(author = format_myself(author, "AM Marquard")) %>% 
  mutate(link = make_scholar_link(pubid, .env$id)) %>% 
  mutate(title = str_trunc(title, 50)) %>% 
  mutate(title = glue("[{title}]({link})")) %>% 
  select(-cid, -pubid, -link) %>%
  arrange(desc(year), desc(cites)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
