## A passion for building bridges between people and their data

I have an eye for optimisation and automation of data analysis workflows, and I believe in the power of giving people meaningful access to their data. This means creating interactive data dashboards, and automating reporting by creating eg. Word/Excel/Powerpoint products directly from R.
To bring these solutions to life I use R package development, R markdown, Shiny tidyverse, unit testing, github actions and bash where needed.

I want to make life easier for both the data scientist as well as the people who own the data.

### Experience

`Jun 2021 - Apr 2022` **Maternity leave** (10 months)

`Mar 2021 - Present` **Director, Head of Data Science & Automation** (Clinical Microbiomics)

* Leading efforts to automate and scale the data analysis operations
* Lead developer of internal R packages and Shiny dashboards
* Managing a team of student assistants

`Aug 2019 - Mar 2021` **Bioinformatics specialist** (Clinical Microbiomics)

* Analysed microbiome data and reported results to clients
* Identified a need for better code sharing, automation and reproducibility
* Independently initiated and led development of:
  - internal R package to track and maintain analysis code
  - internal R package to automate generation of reports
  - code testing during CI, and branch protection
  - Shiny dashboards for clients to interact with their data and statistical analyses

`Jun 2019` **Freelance bioinformatics expert** (Immumap Services)

* Developed a software tool with a Shiny interface to be used by lab staff
  - The tool analyses NGS data from the dCODE platform, a single-cell approach to detect >1000 antigen specificities of T cells in blood samples. 

`Aug 2017 - Aug 2018` **Maternity leave** (12 months)

`Oct 2016 - May 2019` **Postdoc** (T-cells and Cancer lab, DTU Health Technology)

* Major accomplishments:
    - data analysis pipeline for single cell sequencing of T cells with antigen-specificity screening using DNA barcodes
    - pipeline to predict neoepitopes arising at novel exon-exon junctions upon aberrant mRNA splicing in disease
    - R package for predicting cross-reactivity of T cells to avoid adverse effects of 
       immunotherapy *(published)* 
    - Shiny dashboard for point-and-click ggplot-powered visualisation of high-throughput data (to replace Graph Pad Prism)
* I supported the research team with *ad hoc* data analysis and visualisation
* I set up automated analyses where possible to minimize human errors 
  and workload

`Jul 2015 - Apr 2016` **Maternity leave** (9 months)
  
`Jun 2015` **External research stay** (Ton Schumacher Lab, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital, Amsterdam)


### Awards

`2017` Recipient of DTU’s Young Researcher Award


### Education

`2012 - 2016` **PhD in Cancer Genomics** (DTU Bioinformatics)

  * Developed a user-friendly tool for analysing sequencing results of a novel 
    screening method using DNA barcodes
    (available [here](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?Barracoda-1.8))
  * R package that uses machine learning to trace the organ source of cancer 
    cells via DNA analyses (interface available [here](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?TumorTracer-1.1))
  * Infer patterns of mutations from genomic data in >5000 cancer patients, to
    reveal vulnerability to certain types of chemotherapy
  
  
`2012` **Machine Learning course** (by Stanford Uni at Coursera.org)  

`2006 - 2012` **BSc and MSc in Molecular Biomedicine** (Uni. of Copenhagen)

`2006` **Study abroad** (University of New South Wales, Australia)


### Volunteering & student jobs

`2007 - 2011` **Board member and chairman** (Biocenter Student House) | *Learning to organise events, people and paperwork.*

`2010 - 2011` **Student assistant** (The Finsen Laboratory, Copenhagen University Hospital) | *Responsible for genotyping of mice for breeding and experiments.*

`2008 – 2010` **Student assistant** (Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory, Copenhagen University Hospital) | *Preparation of patient blood samples for diagnosis and research, eg. buffy coat and DNA extraction.*

`2007 – 2008` **Assistant press officer** (Dept. of Biology, University of Copenhagen) | *Design of department website and English translations.*



### Publications

```{r scholar_functions, echo=FALSE}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
id <- "UFlhrz0AAAAJ"
pubs <- scholar::get_publications(id)

pubs %>%
  filter(cites > 0 & journal != "") %>%
  mutate(author = format_myself(author, "AM Marquard")) %>% 
  mutate(link = make_scholar_link(pubid, .env$id)) %>% 
  mutate(title = str_trunc(title, 50)) %>% 
  mutate(title = glue("[{title}]({link})")) %>% 
  select(-cid, -pubid, -link) %>%
  arrange(desc(year), desc(cites)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
