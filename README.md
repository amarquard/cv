## The biologist who learnt to code

I build bridges between wet-lab scientists and bioinformaticians. I’ve
spent \>5 years on either side of the divide and I therefore speak both
lab-talk and code-lingo. Below is an overview of what I do: I understand
this
<span style="color:#238B45;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger">biology</span>,
I can study it with these
<span style="color:#CB181D;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger">technologies</span>,
and I can make sense of the data using these
<span style="color:#2171B5;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger">computer
programs</span>. <!-- Expand a little, perhaps tailored to Novo -->

### Experience

`Jun 2021 - Apr 2022` **Maternity leave** (10 months)

`Mar 2021 - Present` **Director, Head of Data Science & Automation**
(Clinical Microbiomics)

`Aug 2019 - Mar 2021` **Bioinformatics specialist** (Clinical
Microbiomics)

  - 
`Jun 2019` **Freelance bioinformatics expert** (Immumap Services)

  - I developed a software tool needed for analysis of NGS data from the
    dCODE platform used for detection of more than 1000 different
    antigen-specific T cells.

`Aug 2017 - Aug 2018` **Maternity leave** (12 months)

`Oct 2016 - May 2019` **Postdoc** (Hadrup Lab, DTU Health Technology)

  - The group works on immunotherapy of cancer and autoimmune diseases
    and consists of 30 experimentalists and 2 bioinformaticians. I
    completed the following projects:
    1.  Establish an analysis pipeline for single cell sequencing of T
        cells in parallel with antigen-specificity screening using DNA
        barcodes
    2.  Predict neoepitopes arising at novel exon-exon junctions upon
        aberrant mRNA splicing in disease (such as myelodysplastic
        syndrome)
    3.  Predicting cross-reactivity of T cells to avoid adverse effects
        of immunotherapy *(published)*
    4.  Prediction of antigenic peptides in mouse tumor models
        *(published)*
  - My tasks also included data analysis and visualisation for other
    projects, as well as setting up automated analysis where possible to
    minimize errors and workload

`Jul 2015 - Apr 2016` **Maternity leave** (9 months)

`Jun 2015` **External research stay** (Ton Schumacher Lab, Antoni van
Leeuwenhoek Hospital, Amsterdam)

  - AI-based prediction of antigenic peptides for cancer immunotherapy

### How I built the bridge:

``` r
#' Plot a bridge using cosine function and ggplot lines and segments
#'
#' @param p the x-axis value at which to plot the pillars (at p and -p) in the graph coordinates
#'
#' @return a ggplot object
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' plot_bridge(2)
#' 
plot_bridge <- function(p) {
  
  # x values around two pillars at position p and minus p
  x <- seq(-2*p, 2*p, length.out = 10000)
  
  # Hyperbolic cosine to get the centre curve
  y <- cosh(x)
  
  # Extend by repeating parts of the centre curve at the ends
  y[x < -p] <- y[x >= 0 & x <  p]
  y[x >  p] <- y[x <= 0 & x > -p]
  
  df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
  
  ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    ylim(0.5, cosh(p)) +
    
    # add road
    geom_hline(yintercept = 1, size = 1) +
    
    # add pillars
    geom_vline(xintercept = c(-p, p), size = 1.3) +
    
    # add ropes
    geom_segment(aes(x = x, y = 1, xend = x, yend = y),
                 data = df[round(seq(1, 10000, length.out = 61)),]) +
    
    # remove all axes etc.
    theme_void()
}
```
